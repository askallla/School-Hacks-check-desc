# Steps

1. copy the code in script.js
2. If you can and you will prob be able to is to go to chrome://extensions
3. Go to developer tools in chrome://extensions and it should be enabled.
4. Go to securly.com and click: CTRL + SHIFT + I. Then paste the code into the console
5. Click the button once and it should say Securly slept with a fish button. It should say "ON"
6. Enjoy and zek-c doesn't know what he is doing so don't trust him.

NOTICE: I came up with this idea and I am very smart if anyone claims or states that this was there idea i will prove them wrong and i have date and time stamps on when this was created.
NOTICE2: Your actions doesn't effect me do this at your own responsibilty.
